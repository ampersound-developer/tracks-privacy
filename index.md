## Overview

Tracks ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS application.

## Data Collection

### Location Data
- **What We Collect:** GPS location data to track walking/running distance
- **Purpose:** Calculate distance traveled to unlock story chapters
- **Storage:** All location data is processed and stored locally on your device only
- **Sharing:** Location data is never transmitted to external servers or third parties

### Health Data (Apple Health Integration)
- **What We Collect:** Walking + Running Distance from Apple Health
- **Purpose:** 
  - Track distance when the app is not actively running
  - Provide seamless distance tracking across app sessions
  - Enable distance-based stories and challenges
  - Unlock content based on your movement activity
- **Permissions:** You must explicitly grant permission through iOS Health app settings
- **Storage:** Health data is accessed read-only and processed locally on your device
- **Sharing:** Health data is never transmitted to external servers or third parties

### App Usage Data
- **What We Store:** Current chapter, distance traveled, chapters unlocked, user preferences (miles vs. kilometers), playback position
- **Storage:** All stored locally on your device using iOS SharedPreferences
- **Sharing:** Never shared with third parties

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely to:
1. Track distance to unlock story chapters and content
2. Save your progress and preferences
3. Sync walking/running distance from Apple Health
4. Display your journey statistics
5. Enable distance-based stories, challenges, and interactive experiences
6. Remember playback position and active story

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage Only:** All data is stored exclusively on your device
- **No Cloud Sync:** We do not sync your data to any cloud service
- **No External Servers:** The app does not communicate with external servers
- **iOS Security:** Data is protected by iOS sandbox security

## Analytics & Tracking

Tracks does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not collect usage data or behavioral information.

## Third-Party Services

Tracks does not integrate with any third-party services or SDKs that collect data.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit any of your data to third parties.** All data stays on your device.

## Apple Health Integration

### Permissions Required
- **Walking + Running Distance:** Read access only

### How We Use Health Data
1. Query distance data from when you first opened the app
2. Sync automatically when app opens and periodically while tracking
3. Calculate progress toward unlocking stories and content
4. Enable distance-based challenges and interactive experiences
5. Track sample IDs to prevent duplicate counting

### Your Health Data Rights
- You can revoke Health access anytime in iOS Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices
- Revoking access will disable Health integration but the app will continue working with GPS tracking
- We never write data back to Apple Health
- We never share your Health data with anyone

## Location Services

### How We Use Location
- Track distance while app is open and you're moving
- Continue tracking in background when app is minimized (if "Always" permission granted)
- Calculate progress toward next chapter unlock
- Update lock screen controls with current progress

### Location Permissions
- You must grant "While Using App" or "Always" location permission
- You can change permissions in iOS Settings → Tracks → Location
- Denying permission will prevent distance tracking

## Your Data Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access:** View all your progress in the app's Stats/Journey page
- **Delete:** Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all local data
- **Export:** Use the share/export feature to save your journey data
- **Restart:** Reset progress for any story
- **Control:** Disable location or Health access in iOS Settings anytime

## Data Retention

Data is retained on your device until you:
- Uninstall the app
- Reset a story's progress
- Delete the app data through iOS Settings

No data is retained on external servers (we don't have any).

## Children's Privacy

Tracks Story does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since all data is stored locally and we don't collect any online data, COPPA compliance is inherent in our design.
